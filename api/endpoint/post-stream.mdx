The `/stream` endpoint allows you to query and stream data from a specific dataset. By default, it uses the Ethereum Mainnet dataset, but you can switch to any other dataset by changing the URL path.

### Example: Track Vitalik's Wallet Transactions

```bash
curl -X POST "https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/ethereum-mainnet/stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "evm",
    "fromBlock": 20494139,
    "toBlock": 20494161,
    "fields": {
      "transaction": {
        "hash": true,
        "from": true,
        "to": true,
        "value": true,
        "gasUsed": true
      },
      "block": {
        "number": true
      }
    },
    "transactions": [
      {
        "from": ["0xef02db3C7D50Afb150511EcB2C54EE854397bD18"]
      },
      {
        "to": ["0xef02db3C7D50Afb150511EcB2C54EE854397bD18"]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

This query will:
- Track transactions from blocks 20494139 to 20494161
- Get transactions where Vitalik's wallet (0xef02db3C7D50Afb150511EcB2C54EE854397bD18) is either the sender or receiver
- Return transaction details like hash, from, to, value, and gas used
- Include block numbers for each transaction
